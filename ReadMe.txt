This code is a half-finished upgrade from Moodle 1.9 to Moodle 2.3 of an activity module (mod). 

Its function is to offer a reflective survey for charity volunteers. 

It was first developed for Macmillan Cancer Support in collaboration with Nigel Hulls of Core Education in New Zealand,
and is now being developed further by Richard Millwood at Core Education UK.
